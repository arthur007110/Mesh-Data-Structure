## Project Description
This project has been developed for the course of "CG" at the University Universidade Federal do Agreste de Pernambuco. The project consists in the implementation of a mesh data structure, which is a data structure that represents a 3D object. The mesh data structure is composed of vertices and faces. The project has been developed in C language by Arthur Costa Gomes.

## Run
To run build the exec file, run the following command:
```
gcc *.c -o exec
```

Then run the exec file:
```
./exec
```

## Run with debugger
To run the the exec file with debugger, run the following command:
```
gcc exec.c mesh.c -g -O0 -W -Wall
```
  
Then press `[F5]` to run the debugger.
> **Note:** The debugger used is `gdb`.
> 
> **Note:** Visual Studio Code is needed to run the debugger with the `[F5]` shortcut.
> 
> **Note:** The `launch.json` file is needed to run the debugger with the `[F5]` shortcut.
> 
> **Note:** If you want to run the debugger without the Visual Studio Code, run the following command:
> ```
> gdb a.out
> ```
